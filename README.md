I am passionate about Computer Programming and Mathematics. I like teaching.
Coding and solving mathematical problems give me a sense of accomplishment and 
make me feel that I am innovating and creating something new. My career path so
far has combined both of my interests (programming and teaching) and it has been
a rewarding experience. I hope to do more for my community by implementing
software that will serve as a great resource repository for educational purposes
and make it available to everyone in Haiti.
